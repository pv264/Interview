Hi, my name is Pavan Venkat. I'm a Cloud and DevOps Engineer with around four years of experience in IT .

In my current role as a Cloud Engineer at TechnoIdentity, I'm responsible for creating and managing scalable Infrastructure for LLM deployments. I have automated this entire environment using Terraform, which successfully reduced our manual deployment time from days down to just a few hours.

Before this, I spent over three years at TCS, where I built my foundational DevOps skills. While , my role was focused on designing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, and managing applications with Docker and Kubernetes.

I'm excited to bring my experience in automating complex cloud systems to a new challenge.

I’m currently handling standard Cloud Infrastructure tasks, but I’m eager to utilize my automation skills more effectively. I’m looking for a dual-function role where I can combine Cloud Engineering with DevOps practices—specifically using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD tools to build scalable, automated systems."


In my current role, I’ve built a solid foundation in cloud fundamentals. Now, I’m looking to apply those skills to more complex architectures where I can focus on large-scale deployments and multi-layered security. I’m specifically looking for the challenge of managing these systems for multiple customers, as it requires a much higher level of technical depth than my current environmen
