1️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline Optimization Issues

Have you optimized any CI/CD pipeline because of an issue you observed?

Yes, common issues include long build times, redundant steps, and security vulnerabilities. Optimization strategies include parallelizing jobs, caching dependencies, and removing unnecessary steps.

What are some real-time issues in CI/CD that require optimization?

Slow build/test times, flaky tests, unoptimized artifact storage, excessive permissions in deployment pipelines, and lack of rollback mechanisms.

2️⃣ Prisma Defender Image Scanning

What are the outputs that appear in the console after scanning an image using Prisma Defender?

Prisma Defender provides vulnerability reports including severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low), compliance status, package details, and remediation suggestions.

3️⃣ SonarQube Code Analysis

What is a code smell in SonarQube?

A code smell refers to maintainability issues that don’t necessarily cause failures but make the code harder to understand and modify.

What is the difference between code smell, bug, and vulnerability in SonarQube?

Code Smell: Maintainability issues.

Bug: Functional errors that could cause incorrect behavior.

Vulnerability: Security weaknesses that could be exploited.

4️⃣ Deploying MySQL on AWS EC2

What strategy would you use to deploy a MySQL server into an EC2 instance in AWS?

Choose an appropriate EC2 instance type, install MySQL, configure security groups to allow database access, enable automated backups, and use AWS RDS if managed service is preferred.

5️⃣ EKS Microservice Access to DynamoDB

A developer requests access for a microservice running in an EKS cluster to connect with DynamoDB. How would you implement this?

Use IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) to grant fine-grained access to DynamoDB, ensuring the least privilege principle.

6️⃣ DynamoDB Overview

What is DynamoDB?

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that offers high performance, scalability, and built-in security features.

7️⃣ Cloud Cost Optimization Strategies

What are some cost optimization strategies while using cloud services?

Right-sizing instances, using Reserved or Spot instances, leveraging auto-scaling, optimizing storage, using serverless architectures, and monitoring spending with cost management tools.

8️⃣ Right-Sizing in Cloud Computing

What does right-sizing mean in cloud computing?

Right-sizing refers to selecting the most appropriate cloud resources based on actual usage patterns to avoid over-provisioning and reduce costs.
