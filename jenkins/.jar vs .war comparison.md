# 📘 Detailed Notes: Standalone Applications, Web Applications, JAR & WAR

## 1️⃣ What is an Application (Basic Foundation)

Applications are broadly classified based on how they run and how users access them:
* **Standalone Applications**

## 2️⃣ Standalone Application (Detailed)

### 🔹 Definition
A **standalone application** is an application that runs independently on a machine without requiring a web browser or an external application server. It is executed directly by the operating system or runtime (like JVM, Python, Node).

### 🔹 Key Characteristics
* Runs independently.
* No browser required.
* Can run in foreground or background.
* Can expose APIs and receive traffic.
* Can be containerized (Docker, Kubernetes).
