“Hi, my name is Pavan. I have over 4 years of experience in IT, primarily in Cloud and DevOps roles.

Currently, I’m working as a Cloud Engineer at Technoidentity, where I manage secure, scalable AWS infrastructure supporting GenAI deployments. My day-to-day work involves services like EC2, VPC, S3, Auto Scaling, and EKS, and I focus heavily on reliability, performance, and troubleshooting production issues in containerized environments.

Before this, I worked at TCS for more than 3 years in a customer-facing DevOps role. I started by handling L1 production issues related to deployments, and as I gained experience, I was promoted to Senior System Engineer, where I handled L3 and L4 tickets, including deeper root-cause analysis, complex incident troubleshooting, and coordinating fixes with multiple teams.

Across both roles, I’ve spent a lot of time diagnosing issues across AWS infrastructure, Kubernetes, Linux systems, and CI/CD pipelines, and communicating findings clearly to stakeholders.

I’m excited about the Senior Technical Solutions Engineer role at Databricks because it combines deep cloud troubleshooting, distributed systems, and direct customer impact, which aligns very closely with the work I’ve been doing and the direction I want to grow in.”**
