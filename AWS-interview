AWS DevOps Interview Questions and Answers
Theoretical Questions
1. What is AWS Lambda, and how does it fit into a serverless architecture?
Answer: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests and charges only for the compute time used. In a serverless architecture, Lambda integrates with services like API Gateway for HTTP endpoints, DynamoDB for data storage, and S3 for file storage, enabling event-driven, scalable applications without managing infrastructure.
2. Explain the key differences between Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda.
Answer: 

EC2: Provides virtual servers for full control over the OS, software, and hardware. Suitable for long-running applications requiring custom configurations.
Lambda: Serverless, event-driven compute service with automatic scaling and no server management. Best for short-lived, event-triggered tasks.
Use Case: EC2 for traditional applications; Lambda for microservices or event-driven workflows.
Cost: EC2 charges per instance-hour; Lambda charges per execution and duration.

3. What is Amazon RDS, and what are its benefits?
Answer: Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service supporting engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. Benefits include automated backups, patching, scaling, and high availability through Multi-AZ deployments. It simplifies database management, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure.
4. How does Amazon S3 ensure data durability and availability?
Answer: S3 provides 99.999999999% (11 9s) durability by redundantly storing data across multiple devices in multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. It ensures 99.99% availability through automatic failover and replication. Features like versioning and cross-region replication further enhance durability.
5. What is the difference between Amazon ECS and EKS?
Answer: 

ECS: A fully managed container orchestration service with simpler setup, ideal for AWS-native container workloads.
EKS: A managed Kubernetes service that supports Kubernetes workloads, offering greater flexibility and portability across clouds.
Use Case: ECS for simpler, AWS-specific deployments; EKS for complex, Kubernetes-based applications.

6. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and why is it important?
Answer: IaC is the practice of managing infrastructure using code, enabling automated, repeatable, and version-controlled deployments. Tools like AWS CloudFormation and Terraform define resources in templates, reducing manual errors, ensuring consistency, and enabling rapid scaling. IaC is critical for DevOps to align infrastructure with agile development practices.
7. What are the advantages of using AWS CloudFormation over Terraform?
Answer: 

CloudFormation: Native AWS service, tightly integrated with AWS resources, supports all AWS features, and requires no external setup.
Terraform: Cloud-agnostic, supports multiple providers, and offers a more flexible state management model.
Advantage of CloudFormation: Seamless AWS integration, no external tooling, and native support for new AWS features.

8. Explain the role of AWS IAM in securing AWS resources.
Answer: AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls access to AWS services and resources. It enables fine-grained permissions through policies, supports users, groups, and roles, and integrates with MFA for security. IAM ensures the principle of least privilege, protecting sensitive resources like S3 buckets or EC2 instances.
9. What is a CI/CD pipeline, and why is it important?
Answer: A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. Continuous Integration (CI) ensures frequent code integration with automated testing, while Continuous Deployment (CD) automates releases to production. It improves code quality, reduces deployment risks, and accelerates delivery, aligning with DevOps practices.
10. How does AWS API Gateway work with AWS Lambda?
Answer: API Gateway acts as a front door for Lambda functions, exposing them as RESTful APIs. It handles HTTP requests, routing, authentication, and throttling, triggering Lambda functions to process the requests. The response from Lambda is returned via API Gateway, enabling scalable, serverless APIs.
11. What is a VPC, and why is it important in AWS?
Answer: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an isolated network within AWS where you can launch resources like EC2 instances and RDS databases. It provides control over IP ranges, subnets, routing, and security (via security groups and NACLs). VPCs ensure secure, private communication and protect resources from unauthorized access.
12. What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?
Answer: The AWS Shared Responsibility Model defines security responsibilities:

AWS: Responsible for the security of the cloud (e.g., physical data centers, hardware, and global infrastructure).
Customer: Responsible for security in the cloud (e.g., OS patching, IAM configuration, and application security).This ensures clear delineation of duties for secure cloud operations.

13. What are the benefits of using serverless architectures on AWS?
Answer: 

Cost Efficiency: Pay only for compute time used.
Scalability: Automatic scaling based on demand.
Reduced Management: No server provisioning or maintenance.
Faster Development: Focus on code, not infrastructure.
Example: Lambda + API Gateway for scalable APIs with minimal overhead.

14. How does AWS ensure high availability for its services?
Answer: AWS achieves high availability through:

Multi-AZ Deployments: Replicating resources across Availability Zones.
Load Balancing: Distributing traffic with Elastic Load Balancers.
Auto Scaling: Dynamically adjusting resources based on demand.
Global Infrastructure: Using multiple regions for failover.Example: RDS Multi-AZ ensures failover to a standby instance in another AZ.

15. What is the purpose of AWS CloudWatch in infrastructure monitoring?
Answer: CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources like EC2, Lambda, and RDS. It enables real-time monitoring, alarming, and automated actions (e.g., scaling). CloudWatch dashboards provide insights into system health and performance.
16. What is the difference between an S3 bucket policy and an IAM policy?
Answer: 

S3 Bucket Policy: A resource-based policy attached to an S3 bucket, controlling access to the bucket and its objects for specific users, roles, or accounts.
IAM Policy: An identity-based policy attached to users, groups, or roles, defining their permissions across AWS services, including S3.
Use Case: Bucket policies for cross-account access; IAM policies for user-specific permissions.

17. Explain the concept of eventual consistency in DynamoDB.
Answer: DynamoDB is a NoSQL database with eventual consistency for read operations (unless strongly consistent reads are specified). After a write, data may not immediately reflect in all replicas, but it eventually becomes consistent across all nodes. This trade-off enables high scalability and low latency for read-heavy workloads.
18. What is the AWS CDK, and how does it differ from CloudFormation?
Answer: The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a framework to define infrastructure using programming languages like Python or TypeScript, which compiles to CloudFormation templates. Unlike CloudFormation’s JSON/YAML templates, CDK offers programmatic constructs, modularity, and reusability, simplifying complex infrastructure definitions.
19. How does Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) contribute to fault tolerance?
Answer: ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (e.g., EC2 instances) in different Availability Zones, ensuring no single point of failure. It performs health checks to route traffic only to healthy instances, improving fault tolerance and availability.
20. What is the purpose of AWS Auto Scaling?
Answer: Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances or other resources based on demand, using metrics like CPU usage or request rates. It ensures optimal performance, cost efficiency, and high availability by scaling out during peak loads and scaling in during low demand.
